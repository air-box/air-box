Confidential Computing (CC)
***************************

Confidential Computing is referred to the set of security technologies focused on securing data in use in the cloud and at the edge. By doing so, the goal is to reduce exposure for sensitive data and provide greater control and transparency for cloud and edge users. 

Current approaches in cloud and edge address data at rest and in transit but encrypting data in use is considered the third and possibly most challenge step to providing a fully encrypted lifecycle for sensitive data. 

The need for greater assurances and controls in cloud and edge is driven by the critical or sensitive nature of IP and workload data. At cloud, the driver industries verticals include finance, healthcare, oil and mining, blockchain etc. At edge, they include industrial automation, self driving cars, drone control, AR/VR, etc. Applications for all of these verticals use or are based on a one or more of the technologies like AI/ML, blockchain, 5G, etc. each of which needs greater level of security posed to be satisfied by confidential computing.     

Confidential computing will cater to those needs by enabling encrypted data to be processed in memory without exposing it to the rest of the system including operating systems. It requires support shielded execution environments (SEE), also referred to as trusted execution environment (TEE) in hardware processors (like Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM trustzone) to deliver that.

From existing security, the key difference lies in the threat model which in confidential computing puts privileged system software outside trust. In other words, confidential computing provides security from an advanced adversary with root privileges e.g., malicious insider, hacker leveraging zero day vulnerability, etc.
